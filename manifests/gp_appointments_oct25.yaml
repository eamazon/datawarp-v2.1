        Introduction
        NHS England publishes this information to support winter preparedness and provide information about some activity within primary care. The aim is to inform users, who range from a healthcare professional to an inquiring citizen, about appointments within primary care.
        NHS England produce this information monthly, containing information about the most recent month and the previous twenty nine months. The publication reports the current information therefore changes to historic months may occur.The aim of the publication is to inform users about activity and usage of GP appointments historically and how primary care is impacted by seasonal pressures, such as winter.
        The publication includes important information however, it does not show the totality of GP activity/workload. The data presented only contains information which was captured on the GP practice systems. This limits the activity reported on and does not represent all work happening within a primary care setting.
        In April 2023, NHS England began collecting appointments data recorded in PCN Hub appointment systems to provide a more complete understanding of appointment activity within primary care. This data was first included in the publication in the June 2023 release.
        No patient identifiable information has been collected or is included in this release.
        In August 2020, NHS England and the British Medical Association published “More accurate general practice appointment data – guidance”, which established consistent principles for recording of patient-facing appointments in general practice. As a result of this NHS England has introduced this new set of GP appointment categories to better capture general practice workload and demand. This is achieved by practices assigning a predefined category to the various appointment types within their appointment books. This data, alongside data on the actual duration of appointments, was first included in this publication in the April 2022 release.
