        Introduction
        The aim of the publication is to inform users about patient use of Online Consultation Systems to submit requests to their general practice. NHS England produces this information monthly and provides a time series from April 2023 onwards including practice-level data about system availability and usage.
        This data reflects demand for general practice services, both clinical and administrative, that is received from patients via Online Consultation Systems. It is not a measure of all requests received by practices which may also be received in other ways, for example in person, by telephone call and does not reflect the totality of demand faced by general practice.
        The publication reports the current information so historical figures are subject to change. No patient identifiable information has been collected or is included in this release.
