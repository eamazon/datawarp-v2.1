        Introduction
        Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined by the World Health Organization as being characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning, the level of which is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Historically there has been no specific data publicly available about people with ADHD. The ADHD data improvement plan highlighted the need to make use of and publish existing data held by NHS England in this area whilst also working to improve data quality.

        In this initial publication data is available on the following areas: estimated prevalence of ADHD, the number of open referrals that may be for ADHD assessments, including how long the patient has been waiting and the number of new and closed referrals.

        A full list of measures currently contained in the publication is published in a data dictionary alongside each release
