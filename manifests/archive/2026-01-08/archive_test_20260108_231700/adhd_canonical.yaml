        ADHD Management Information

        Introduction

        Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined by the World Health
        Organization as being characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention
        and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic,
        occupational, or social functioning, the level of which is outside the limits
        of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning.
        Historically there has been no specific data publicly available about people
        with ADHD. The ADHD data improvement plan highlighted the need to make use
        of and publish existing data held by NHS England in this area whilst also
        working to improve data quality.


        In this initial publication data is available on the following areas: estimated
        prevalence of ADHD, the number of open referrals that may be for ADHD assessments,
        including how long the patient has been waiting and the number of new and
        closed referrals.


        A full list of measures currently contained in the publication is published
        in a data dictionary alongside each release
