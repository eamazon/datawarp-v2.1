        Primary Care Network Workforce, England
        Bulletin Tables, March 2020 - October 2025
        Official Statistics

        Introduction
        This document contains workforce figures for Primary Care Networks (PCNs).
        The PCN workforce is separate and distinct from the GP practice workforce although some individuals may work part-time in both types of organisation.
        Information for users
        This publication relates solely to the workforce directly accountable to the PCN and contains no information about GP practices or their staff.
        However, information about the GP practice workforce is published in a separate series of Official Statistics and now includes details of GP Practice staff within a PCN footprint.
        General Practice Workforce: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/general-and-personal-medical-services
        The full-time equivalent (FTE) recorded for contracted services are for where a role is not permanently staffed by a single named individual but the working hours are instead covered by a combination of people employed by another organisation and deployed to the PCN.
        Contracted services data captures no personal information about the staff fulfilling the contracted responsibilities, only the total hours of work provided, and therefore no headcount information is available for these roles.
        As a result there is no inferable relationship between the FTE and Headcount figures in these tables.
        Membership of a PCN it is not mandatory and some practices have chosen not to join. Of the existing PCNs, some have not yet provided any workforce information to this collection and figures do not include estimates for those PCNs not yet providing workforce information.
        PCNs are intended to cover 100% of the resident population in England and, in general, groups of PCNs can often be considered to align to Sub-ICB Location boundaries.
        In most PCNs, the GP practice members are from within the same Sub-ICB Location. However, where there are exceptions we have recorded the PCN under its Sub-ICB Location although this may not be the Sub-ICB Location for all its practice members.
